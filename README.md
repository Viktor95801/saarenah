## About it

Just a silly little arena stb-style library I made for my own projects. If you want to use it, I see no reason why not, except it is probably not as robust neither tested enough as [Tsoding's arena.h](https://github.com/tsoding/arena/blob/master/arena.h) or most other implementations you may see on the internet.
